    |We managed to combine 21 SKUs into one item for express selection of Chai.

    |Before the designing the website and the accompanying app, we had to do some housekeeping. Over 75% revenues were being contributed by three chai flavours so the mobile app was primarily targeted at these repeat users who come often to order their favorite chai. We designed a unique experience for this use case where we managed to integrate over 21 Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) in one screen by bifurcating these SKUs into 7 flavors with three sizes.

    |Unlike the app, website had a bigger mandate to not only help users order their chai online but to tell the Chai Point story and communicate their offline offerings as well.

    |We needed to tell the customers about world’s best tea vending machine called “BoxC “ which is an IOT driven system and managed by Chai Point. It also had to draw attention to curated collection of gourmet tea from the best tea estates in india, help them locate their nearest chai point store. It was a balance of a website optimised for quick conversions, fast checkout and efficient marketing.
