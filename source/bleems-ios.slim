    |Bleems is a marketplace for local flowers, cakes and gifts shops. They had a lot of drop offs on their previous app and website, and they left it completely on us to provide their users a seamless experience as to increase their sales. The company is operational in middle east only, so it was very important for us to understand the behavioural pattern of the users there.

    |Category and Occasions <span class="border ML0-imp"></span>
  p
    |There are two kinds of people who come on the app - people who know what they want, and people who donâ€™t know what they are looking for. One thing that they surely know is the occasion. Easy navigation of categories and occasions was indispensable for the app. So, users could either shop by category - cakes, flowers and gifts or shop by occasions.

    |Sending gifts to multiple people <span class="border ML0-imp"></span>
  p
    |E-commerce is not very difficult to build nowadays, but it was very important for us to keep the checkout process as a no brainer for all the users. We realised that a lot of users of this app send gifts to multiple people which was not very efficient in the previous app. It took a lot of ideations and brainstorming sessions to come up with a smooth checkout process when the user wants to send the gifts to multiple people.
