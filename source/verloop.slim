    |Chatbots interact with more customers faster than humans will ever be able to.

  p
    |The founder Gaurav approached us after product validation and getting some initial paying customers. It was ready to go global and needed the product to look rounded and competent as per international standards. One of our chief objectives with Verloop was simplifying information exchange between the chatbot and customers for improved interactions. Our first priority was to get the Verloop brand to show through the user’s interactions with the bot.

  p.quote.verloop
    |The logo was designed to reflect a modern yet approachable personality.

      |These were ideas which were transformed from sketches into digital mocks. This was shortly before taking a complete U-turn on logo concepts.
  p
    |We went through several iterations on concepts for the logo, many of them revolving around the concept of infinity. But over time we realised that our approach was flawed. We dramatically altered our ideas to instead reflect something more abstract, the personality of the bot.

      |This approachable personality was achieved through a modified ellipsis. With the logo extended to an FAB, the ellipsis would give the impression of ‘eyes’ and even blink occasionally. This would also increase brand recall on the thousands of websites into which the widget would be embedded.

    |The design was fine-tuned keeping certain usability heuristics for the technology in mind.

    |Just as a website design can be judged based on certain usability heuristics, many of the same can be adapted for use in a bot. Below are instances where these criteria came into play.

      |<span class="bold">System status communication -</span> The system’s status should be clear to the user, whether further input is expected or the bot is processing provided input. The above interaction was designed to communicate to the user that the bot was “thinking”.

  p.caption
    |<span class="bold">Minimalist design and consistency across websites -</span>The visual system had to be adaptable to the visual language of each website while the brand of Verloop had to be preserved.
