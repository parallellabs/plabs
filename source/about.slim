			h2 
				| We are a product design lab with a lean and jargon-free approach to designing great products.
			p.para
				| Parallel Labs was found on the belief that creating successful products needs something beyond a client-agency model. It needs a engagement where we work in parallel with the client team as a partner who understands their business, customers and will walk along on the product journey.
			p
				| Our team is intentionally small and we work on limited assignments at a time. Clients are part of our design process where we share ideas, brainstorm, debate and critique to constantly improve and iterate our craft.
