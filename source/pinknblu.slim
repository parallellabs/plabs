    li Discover - Helps parents find them everything from interesting events for kids in their neightbourhood to the best pediatrician in locality.
    li Share - Record precious moments of your kid and share them selectively with family and friends. 
    li Community - Connect with other parents in chat groups and by reading & sharing experiences.

    |Research is the key when Bachelors design a parenting app<span class="border ML0-imp"></span>
  p
    |We generally believe in “Just Enough Research” as a philosophy and believe in a lean approach to design where we move fast and iterate continously, and what helps us do that us our extremely good understanding of consumer bahvior.
  p 
    |But what do you do when you a team of bachelors in their twenties gets on to design a parenting app. Hence, it was a project which needed research into parenting. It was great fun talking to parents understanding the issues they face in parenting, how do they share responsibilities and what can make their life simpler.

    |Family Owned Kids Profiles and On-boarding<span class="border ML0-imp"></span>
  p 
    |Pinknblu has a unique onboarding and account structure. Since most children will be minors across different age groups typically from 0-8 years, the profile a child has to be created by a parent. At the same time, we wanted parents to share reminders, moments and a lot of other information about their kid. Hence, we designed an account creation process where parents sign up for themselves and create profile of their kids and they can invite others to manage the kids’ profile like the spouse, siblings, nanny etc. and jointly share moments and responsibilities.

    |It has to be a tab bar when everything is important<span class="border ML0-imp"></span>
  p 
    |App had a combination of discovery elements and three key call to actions. The discovery elements were activity, resources, chat and experience. and actions were to create a Reminder, Experience or Moment. Hence after lot of exploration we came up with a hybrid tab bar which uses a combination of tab bar along with a floating action button as per Google’s Material design guidelines.

    |Facilitating discussions about information in chat<span class="border ML0-imp"></span>
  p
    |With the intent of making discussions in chats with friends and groups more meaningful and contextual, we added a discuss workflow which allows sharing a listing on chat and discuss around it.
