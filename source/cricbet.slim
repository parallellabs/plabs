    |As a design consulting firm, we are always in search for an opportunity to do something different and challenging. Which is why when Cricbet approached us to redesign the game, being avid gamers we were thrilled about the prospect of designing it.
  p
    |Design a game is a completely different ball game. Unlike designing experiences for apps or websites where the focus is to make it simple and no-brainer, game design needs a completely opposite approach where you need to reveal information in learners and not be the obvious. Predictability and standards kill a app experience and hence being used to designing UX for apps, we had a lot to unlearn which made it even more fun.

    |The mystery of wireframing a game<span class="border ML0-imp"></span>
  p
    |Defining the workflow for the project and wireframing the experience was tough. At every step, we would have to stop ourselves on trying to simplify the workflow and work tangentially on what can be done to gamify the experience.

    |Designing a interactive flow and not just screens<span class="border ML0-imp"></span>
  p
    |Designing a game is all about interactions and it needs a completely different approach. Instead of designing screens independently, we crafted interactions and screens that flow from one to the other with seamless transitions.

    |Realtime experience to bet on every ball<span class="border ML0-imp"></span>
  p
    |Ball by ball gaming mode was the most interesting playing mode for the game where players can play with a group of 5-6 random players or with their own friends and bet on every ball. The idea was to bring the excitement people have while watching a live match on television to the playground and engage them to predict what happens on the next ball. Since it was a high engagement mode where players bet on every ball and we wanted to show what other 5 players are betting on, we chose a landscape view for this mode. Visually the idea was to replicate the metaphor of watching the match from a stadium.
