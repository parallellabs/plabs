		p 
			|	Housejoy approached to design the experience for their web app which is primarily targeted at first time users. Instead of going app only, a seamless booking experience on desktop and mobile web was equally important since home services is a new segment in the indian market and the website experience needed to communicate the value proposition, pricing and let users make their first booking easily without having to download the app. 
		p
			| The key challenges included creating design patterns that allow different workflows for each service type while still making the overall experience seamless and automatic workflow for subjective tasks where the cost differs from case to case.
