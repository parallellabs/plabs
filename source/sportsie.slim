    |Designing a gaming app is a completely different ball game (pardon the pun). Unlike designing experiences for apps or websites where the focus is to make it simple and no-brainer, game design needs a completely opposite approach where you need to pick and choose when to reveal information. The most straightforward approach is not necessarily the best game mechanic.

        |It has a very linear flow where a user needs to pick a category every time to play a quiz. A game needs to be interactive and facilitate discovery.

    |We spoke to three users of the app to get insights into the minds of our audience. These were diverse users right from someone who was new to the app to a betting pro who also happened to be the highest buyer of virtual money on the platform.

    |Wireframing a game requires a different hat than the one we wear while designing utility apps.

    |Defining the workflow for the project and wireframing the experience was tough. At every step, we had to stop ourselves from over simplifying the workflow as games need to have a sense of mystery and incremental revelation. This approach is counter to the standard UX norms of other apps. Standard navigation patterns will not work for Sportsie because the needs of the user are different from a conventional app like, say, Gmail.
