        </p>
        <p viii>
          As such, Service Provider shall be fully responsible for any and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs suffered by or in respect of a customer, caused in whole or in part by the Service Provider.
        </p>
        <p ix>
            Notwithstanding anything to contrary, Parallellabs's entire liability to you shall be the refund of the money charged from you for any specific Gift Card, under which the unlikely liability arises. Under no circumstance shall Parallellabs be liable for any consequential, indirect or remote loss that you or your friends and family may suffer.
